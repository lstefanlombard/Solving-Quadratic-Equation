# Quadratic Equation Solver

This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that solves quadratic equations of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI, allowing users to input coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), and receive the solutions directly in the application.

## Features

- Input coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to solve the quadratic equation.
- Display solutions based on the discriminant:
  - Two real solutions
  - One real solution
  - No real solutions
- Clear input fields and output with a single button click.
- User-friendly interface with labeled entry fields.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- Math library (included in Python's standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quadratic-equation-solver.git
   cd quadratic-equation-solver
